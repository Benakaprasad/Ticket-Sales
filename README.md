**Ticket Sales Reservation System**
-This ticket sales reservation system is designed for various event platforms such as concerts, stadiums, and convention centers. It supports two ticket modes to provide flexible access options for attendees:

-Ticket Modes

1.Individual Pass:
Standard tickets available on a first-come, first-served basis.

2.VIP Pass:
Premium tickets that grant priority access and exclusive benefits.

-Reservation Process
Users must enter the following details to secure their tickets:

-Pass type (Individual or VIP)

--Name

--Email ID

-The system operates using a priority queue approach:

-VIP passes are processed first, ensuring VIP customers receive top priority for ticket allocation.

-Individual passes are then processed in the order they were received (FIFO - First In, First Out).

-This system ensures fair and efficient ticket distribution by giving precedence to VIP customers while managing individual pass reservations in arrival order.
